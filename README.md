# Ray Tracer

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/jcsho/ray-tracer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcsho/ray-tracer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Rust implementation of [the Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck.

The book only provides test scenarios (in [cucumber format](https://cucumber.io)) and pseudocode.

All code is created by myself unless commented otherwise.

## Dev Logs & Progression

I keep track of progress using the Kanban methodology via my [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/jcsho/projects/2)
and separate chapters in corresponding [milestones](https://github.com/jcsho/ray-tracer/milestones)
